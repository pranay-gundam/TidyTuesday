\section{Weekly Summary}

The most interesting regression this week seems like the 09/25 day. Not as much because of the regression itself,
but more so because of the relationship between the data that we can see on the graph itself. Specifically the two
series are Nonfarm "Private Goods - Producing Large Payroll Employment" and "Mortgage Debt Outstanding by Type of 
Holder: Federal and Related Agencies". There seems to be a clear discontinuity with the omrtgage Dept series, where
dept is only either above 5 million or below 1 million and there is no outstanding mortgage dept above 5 million on
the same years that the private goods series is above 7500. I'm not so sure what else there is to say about this
without more investigation but it would be interesting to see if this relationship was brought about by some nuance
in the years in which this data for either series occured or if there really is some roundabout story to delve into.
