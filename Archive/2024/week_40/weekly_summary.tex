\section{Weekly Summary}

Yet another week where I think the two series show such a strong relationship since I haven't detrended anything.
I will say that one way I can at least identify if these series exhibit a clear trend one way or the other is 
simply by plotting both of the timeseries. Outside of this though, I think wages and sales both generally do go
up over time but a detrended regression I would think also has some linkage as well in some trickle down economics
way.
