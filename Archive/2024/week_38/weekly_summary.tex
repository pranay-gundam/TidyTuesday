\section{Weekly Summary}

This week, I'm going to talk mostly about 9/21. The regression was between quarterly Real GDP in wholesale trade 
in the Mideast and total compensation for private industry workers in manufacturing. The regression was significant with an 
R-squared value of 0.807 and shows a strong positive relationship between the two variables. Until I fix the reported regression to
make them more intelligent I'm sure I will see this trend a lot. I feel like relationships between two series that are proxies 
for some other larger macroeconomic trends will be pretty strong but not give much insight into some deeper relationship between
the two series. In this case, for example, the general relationship between GDP and eomployment/compensation is well well studied.
Usually as GDP grows employment and compensation does as well. What is interesting though in this case is that the relationship 
is so strong in the opposite direction. Looking a bit deeper into the series though its clear that this is an matter of not 
detrending either of the series since both show consistent trends where compensation has been increasing but RGDP specifically
in whoelsale Trade in the Mideast has been decreasing.
